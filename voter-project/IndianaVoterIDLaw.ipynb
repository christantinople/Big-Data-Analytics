    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirty-five of the fifty states of the U.S. have passed stricter voter ID laws that require or request voters to present a form of identification at the polls. \n",
    "The remaining fifteen states do not require voters to present any documentation to vote at the polls. States such as Indiana, Wisconsin, and Tennessee have strict photo ID laws for voters, while states such as Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania have no requirements for voter identification. A visualization of the levels of strictness of voter photo identification laws for each state can be seen in the map in **Fig. 1** below.\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of implementing stricter voter identification requirements include preventing voter impersonation, thus  increasing public confidence in election processes. Disadvantages of implementing stricter laws unnecessarily burdens voters and administrators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "In this project, we conduct a case study to see if implementing laws that inhibit the convenience of voting can ultimately lead to decreased voter participation. We focus our investigations of voter identification laws on the state of Indiana, which implemented a strict voter identification law in 2008. We seek to analyze how much voter turnout would have decreased or increased without the implentation of the law. \n",

    "For a first attempt in identitfying if Indiana's voter turnout in 2008 was affected by the strict voter ID law that was implemented during that year, we first fit a logistic regression to the voter turnout variable `General_2008`.

However, the model was only given data from states without voter ID laws to learn from, i.e., all of our working states except for Indiana.\n",

Using a simple difference in averages cannot truly measure the causal effect of a voter ID law, as the people in states outside of Indiana are very different from those in Indiana. \n",

The propensity score is the conditional probability of receiving the treatment, the implementation of the voter identification law. Using this score means that we do not have to achieve conditional independence $(Y_1,Y_0) \\perp |X$. In other words, we do not have to condition on the whole $X$ to achieve independence of potential outcomes of the treatment. Instead, it is sufficient to control confounders $X$ for a propensity score $$P(x)=P(T|X)=E[T|X]$$ to achieve $(Y_1,Y_0) \\perp |P(x)$.\n",

Thus, we hold the propensity score constant to make the data appear more random.\n",

Thus, we can compare people with similar propensity scores. And, if it is actually the case that the remaining chance of being treated (in a state with a voter ID law) is due to chance, and both people have the same propensity score, then we can then take the difference in their observations. \n",

    "We can simplify our propensity score weighting estimator to $E[Y\\frac{T-P(x)}{P(x)(1-P(x)}]$, where $P(x)$ and $(1-P(x))$ both must be greater than $0$. Thus, each voter must have some probability of both receiving and not receiving the treatment of the implementation of a voter identification law.\n",

    "Our result gives an estimated average treatment effect $\\hat{ATE} = 2.18$. This result is nonsensical. We discuss this result later in the summary and discussion section, but in short, because our response variable is from 0 to 1, an ATE of 2.18 would mean an individual with a voter ID law has a 218 percent greater chance of voting, which is obvious ridiculous. \n",
    "\n",
    "Under another two runs of the propensity score estimator, we had an estimate of -19 and +11. Since the outcome variable is either 0 (voted) or 1 (did not vote), that would imply that the effect of the law could have caused a 1100% increase in voter turnout or a 1900% decrease in turnout, clearly implausible numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons we believe the propensity score estimator fails to capture the true causal effect and gives massive standard errors is that we do not have a very representative pool of individuals in states without voter ID laws. In particular, looking at the graph below, we can see that the logistic regression actually does a good job of separating Indiana out from the rest of the states in the U.S. In ordinary prediction settings, this would be a good outcome. However, in the case where we are trying to determine causal effects, this is not optimal, as it means that we have very few individuals living in states without voter ID laws that are actually comparable to those in Indiana. This is a common problem in propensity score matching and can introduce bias and massive variance, something that has clearly happened here."

    "## Doubly Robust Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have used logistic regression to directly model voter turnout, and we have used propensity score weighting to estimate $E[Y|T=1] - E[Y|T=0] | X$ (i.e., the expected difference in liklihood for an Indianan vs other state resident to vote in the 2008). However, we can combine the advantages of both techniques into a single estimator known as the *doubly robust estimator*. The estimator for the average treatment effect is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{ATE} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum \\bigg( \\dfrac{T_i(Y_i - \\hat{\\mu_1}(X_i))}{\\hat{P}(X_i)} + \\hat{\\mu_1}(X_i) \\bigg) - \\frac{1}{N}\\sum \\bigg( \\dfrac{(1-T_i)(Y_i - \\hat{\\mu_0}(X_i))}{1-\\hat{P}(X_i)} + \\hat{\\mu_0}(X_i) \\bigg)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{\\mu_0}(x)$ is an estimate to $E[Y| X, T=0]$ (probability someone with given quality votes given they are from another state), $\\hat{\\mu_1}(x)$ is an estimate to $E[Y| X, T=1]$ (probability someone with given quality votes given they are from Indiana), and $\\hat{P}(x)$ is an estimation of the propensity score.\n",
    "\n",
    "In implementation, we can think of these quantities as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\hat{\\mu_0}(X_i)$: predicted probabilities of voting for all voters given a model is trained on other states.\n",
    "- $\\hat{\\mu_1}(X_i)$: predicted probabilities of voting for all voters given a model is trained on just Indiana.\n",
    "- $\\hat{P}(X_i)$: predicted probabilities of having a voter ID law for all voters given a model is trained on all states.\n",
    "\n",
    "In implementation, our initial run gave us a value of $\\hat{ATE} = 0.047$ which would indicate that someone in Indiana is expected to be 4.7 percent *more* likely to vote than someone from another state. Of course, this number is a point estimate, and we are unsure that about it statistical significance. What's more, it is of the opposite sign that we would expect! **Fig. 4** shows the distribution of $\\hat{P}(x)$ broken down by whether the state had a voter ID law (Indiana) or not (other states). \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenges with running the doubly robust estimator has to do with label balance. We have many more voters living in non-voter-ID states than in voter-ID states. Consequently, each time we run logistic regression, we censor the data to balance the labels. Otherwise, the intercept of the logistic regression would move towards zero as we include more data from non-voter-ID law states, and our propensity score would be pushed downwards to zero. Thus, we sample from non-voter-ID states to get the same number of observations as Indiana. Ideally, we would bootstrap this procedure and obtain a confidence interval via quantile estimates. We, therefore, suspect that the doubly robust estimator is imperfectly estimating the true average treatment effect, as the effect is much larger than we expect (to be able to shift voter turnout by 4-5 percent in a presidential election has massive political ramifications) and the effect has a sign that is opposite to our priors.\n",

    "## Summary and Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the propensity score estimator, we obtain an (implausible) average treatment effect of 220 percent. Using the doubly robust estimator, we obtain an average treatment effect of 4.7 percent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is interesting because the result is actually in the opposite sign of what we would expect. It has the effect of increasing voter turnout rather than decreasing it. One of the ways this could be confounded is by an omitted variable bias. In particular, if Indiana in 2008, for example, was a particularly competitive election compared to other areas that had similar explanatory variables as Indiana, then we would expect the results for Indiana to be skewed upwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, note that we focus here on presidential elections for the sake of simplicity. Other studies of this law using smaller datasets have focused instead on the primary election in 2008, immediately after the law was passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other studies have also had a hard time dealing with getting small enough standard errors. For example, Erikson et al. present a reasonable upper bound on the absolute magnitude of the causal effect as 0.02. They explain that with Current Population Survey (CPS) data, it is extremely difficult to obtain confidence intervals using present econometric methods that come near to that. We had originally hoped that with such a large dataset, with our total sample being in the millions, we would be able to construct standard errors that are more tight and therefore use the law of large numbers to estimate effects that are more precise than those of prior studies. Unfortunately, we were unable to accomplish that here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of the doubly robust estimator is that it seeks to correct the bias by accurately estimating the counterfactual. However, in our case, the estimator's effectiveness was limited. Firstly, the estimated effect's sign was opposite to what we expected. Secondly, since the doubly robust estimator requires the estimation of three different models, it is expensive to run on large datasets, and we could only run it once."
